# SDG 2 - FOOD DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
- This app assists barangays in distributing food fairly to post-disaster areas and low-income neighborhoods. The project addresses United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. The system collects family information, identifies vulnerable households, monitors food stock, and organizes delivery routes. Barangay staff apply a ranking system that prioritizes the most vulnerable families first. Food sources include both community donations and government assistance. Distribution begins immediately upon food arrival, with consideration for expiration dates.
